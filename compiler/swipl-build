#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# This is the script we use to   build  SWI-Prolog and all its packages.
# Copy the script to  `build',  edit   to  suit  the  local installation
# requirements and run it. Once correct, upgrading   to a new release is
# now limited to getting the new sources and run ./build.

# [EDIT] Prefix location of the installation. It is _not_ adviced to use
# a    versioned    prefix.    The    system      will     install    in
# $PREFIX/lib/pl-<version> and create symlinks from  $PREFIX/bin for the
# main  programs.  Users  can  always  use  older  versions  by  running
# $PREFIX/lib/pl-<version>/bin/<arch>/pl
#
# If you change PREFIX such that the system  is installed in a place for
# which you have no write access, set  SUDO   to  the command to run the
# remainder of the commandline as privilaged   user. E.g., if you change
# PREFIX to /usr/local you typically must change SUDO to "sudo"

PREFIX=$HOME/swipl
SUDO=
#SUDO="sudo"

# [EDIT] Version of make to use.  This   must  be GNU-make. On many Unix
# systems this is installed as 'gmake'. On most GNU-based systems (e.g.,
# linux), the default make is GNU-make.  You can use 'make --jobs=<max>'
# to build the system faster using  all   your  cores. The optimal value
# depends a lot on your hardware. Using   4 jobs on a dual-core machines
# seems enough to keep both cores busy. (experimental).

# MAKE=make
MAKE='make --jobs=4'

# [EDIT] Compiler and options.
#
#	CC:	 Which C-compiler to use
#	COFLAGS: Flags for the optimizer such as "-O3" or "-g"
#	CMFLAGS: Machine flags such as "-m64" (64-bits on gcc)
#	CIFLAGS: Include-path such as "-I/opt/include"
#	LDFLAGS: Link flags such as "-L/opt/lib"
#
# Leaving an option blank leaves the  choice to configure. The commented
# values below enable much better C-level debugging with almost the same
# performance on GCC based systems (the default is to compile using -O3)
# For optiomal performance, see also --enable-useprofile below.

# export CC=
# export COFLAGS="-O2 -gdwarf-2 -g3"
# export CMFLAGS=
# export CIFLAGS=
# export LDFLAGS="-O2 -g"

# On MacOS you need this to  get   some  libraries  from Macports. Since
# recently, there are three C compilers:   gcc-llvm  and clang come with
# XCode. Native gcc can  be  installed   in  various  ways  (e.g., using
# Macports). Current SWI-Prolog sources compile and  work with all these
# alternatives. If you want the last bit   of performance and don't mind
# some extra work, get a recent  native   GCC,  set  CC below and enable
# --enable-useprofile (see below).
#
# Recent versions of Quartz  (X11)  seem   to  install  the headers into
# /opt/X11/include. We put this  after   /opt/local/include,  to use the
# Macport version of X11 if this is installed.

if [ "`uname`" = Darwin ]; then
  export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/opt/local/lib
  export CPATH=/usr/include:/opt/local/include:/opt/X11/include
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/X11R6/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/local/lib/pkgconfig
  # export CC="gcc-4.2"
  # export CXX="g++-4.2"
  # export CXXCPP="g++-4.2 -E"
fi

# [EDIT] On Solaris also puts there stuff everywhere ...
# export CIFLAGS=-I/opt/csw/include/ncurses
# export LDFLAGS=-L/opt/csw/lib

# [EDIT] On FreeBSD, java is installed under /usr/local/jdk<version>,
# and the executables are _copied_ to /usr/local/bin. Unfortunately, the
# copy leaves the headers out, so the original files must be used.
# export JAVAC=/usr/local/jdk1.6.0/bin/javac

# [EDIT] On FreeBSD, the following is needed to fetch the headers for
# GMP.
# export CIFLAGS='-I/usr/local/include'

# [EDIT] Extra options to pass to the toplevel configure.

# --link
# Using --link, the system is installed using symbolic links. This means
# you cannot remove or clean  the   sources,  but  it largely simplifies
# editing the system Prolog files during development.
#
# --enable-useprofile
# The config --enable-useprofile exploits GCC  -fprofile-use option. The
# system  is  compiled,  profiled   and    re-compiled   to  get  better
# branch-prediction. This makes the system approx.   10%  faster. Do not
# use this for developing the kernel because it complicates maintenance.
#
# --disable-libdirversion
# By default, the system is  installed in $libdir/swipl-<version>. Using
# this option drops <version>. Using versions,  you can install multiple
# versions side-by-site and run old  versions   at  any time by starting
# $libdir/swipl-<version>/bin/$arch/swipl. Without, the system is always
# at a nice stable place, so external foreign objects linked against the
# binary need not be updated with a Prolog update.
#
# --enable-shared
# Use this to create a shared object  for the Prolog kernel. The default
# depends on the platform. Creating a shared   object  is the default on
# most platforms, either because it is  needed   or  because  it does no
# harm. The only exception to this rule  is Linux on x86 (Intel 32-bit).
# It is not needed on this platform  and Linux shared object model costs
# a CPU register. Given the limited number   of CPU registers on the x86
# platform, this results in a performance degradation of about 10%.
#
# --enable-boehm-gc
# Configure SWI-Prolog to use -a  custom   version  of- bdwgc (Boehm-GC,
# http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/). This is   intended  to
# support  the  next   generation   of    the   SWI-Prolog   RDF   store
# (packages/semweb). DO NOT USE (YET).

# EXTRACFG+=" --link"
# EXTRACFG+=" --enable-useprofile"
# EXTRACFG+=" --disable-libdirversion"
# EXTRACFG+=" --enable-shared"
# EXTRACFG+=" --enable-boehm-gc"
export EXTRACFG

# One possiblity to make relocatable executables   on  Linux is by using
# the RPATH mechanism. See  ld.so(1)   and  chrpath(1). However, chrpath
# cannot enlarge the path. Uncommenting the   line below adds :xxx... to
# the RPATH, where the given count is the number of x-s.
#
# export RPATH_RESERVE=70
